The specification will be split into directories:
one for the model and one for the profiles.

The model directory will have subdirectories per namespace.

Every class will be in its own file.

All the properties of a namespace will be in a single file.

A new repo https://github.com/spdx/spec-v3-template
has been created to include template files.
